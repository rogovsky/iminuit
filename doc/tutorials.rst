Tutorials
=========

All the tutorials are in tutorial directory. You can view them online too:

- `Basic tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit/master/tutorial/basic_tutorial.ipynb>`_.
  Covers the basics of using iminuit.
- `Advanced tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit/master/tutorial/advanced_tutorial.ipynb>`_.
  The advanced tutorial shows you how to speed up the computation of the
  objective function with Cython and how to write wrapper classes that work
  with iminuits parameter name discovery.
- `Hard Core Cython tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/scikit-hep/iminuit/master/tutorial/hard_core_tutorial.ipynb>`_.
  If you need to do a huge likelihood fit that needs speed, this is for you.
  If you don't care, just use `probfit`_.
  It's a fun read though I think.
